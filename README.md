PROJECT CRUD-APP 1.0

This project is my first CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) webapp

Time-taken to complete it was 190 hours over the span of three weeks as I work 9 to 5 as an Accountant

A project that explains the basics of using Node, Express, MongoDB and EJS as template engine. Reagrding EJS, I think I have to find another alternative.
Heard about Handlebars and Pug are better and easier to use logic with without so many confusing partials and modulus :) like EJS

This project will definitely have version 2.0 where I may incorporate some complexities and REACT for the front end

Absolutely loved every process, pain and learning it took me to build

Its a simple basic dashbooard that lets you add a user, update and delete a user...Lest I forget, I used JQuery too...read the documentation and I am surprised JavaScript swept JQuery off the radar...might investigate why its so.

More Projects to complete and keep testing the limits of how far I can push this.

The Developer Accountant...:)
